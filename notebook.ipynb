    "- The necessary library was imported, which is `Pandas`\n",
    " \n",
    "- The Original dataset was loaded, named `ds_jobs` and a copy was made, called `ds_jobs_transformed`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Exploratory Data Analysis was performed which help identify ordinal, nominal, and two-factor categories. This was done by written codes, which iterate over all columns of the DataFrame `ds_jobs` that have a data type of object (typically representing strings or categorical data) and print the value counts of each column.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A dictionary of columns containing ordered categorical data was created. The code defines the dictionary called ordered_cats, which contains lists of ordered categories for various features. These features represent specific categorical data in a dataset (e.g., levels of education, size of the company, work experience, etc.). This dictionary can later be used to create ordered categorical columns, for example, when transforming or encoding data in a pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A mapping dictionary of columns containing two-factor categories to convert to Booleans was created. The code defines a Python dictionary called two_factor_cats. This dictionary is used to map certain categorical values into Boolean (True or False) values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This `for col in ds_jobs_transformed:` code iterates through each column in the `ds_jobs_transformed` DataFrame, performing different transformations based on the column name.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For the columns `'relevant_experience'` and `'job_change'`, if col in `['relevant_experience', 'job_change']:` code uses the `two_factor_cats` dictionary to convert their categorical values into boolean values (True/False).\n",
    "\n",
    "- The .map() function applies the mapping from two_factor_cats (defined previously) to the column. For example:\n",
    "    + `'No relevant experience'` becomes `False`.\n",
    "    + `'Has relevant experience'` becomes `True`.\n",
    "    + `0.0` becomes `False`.\n",
    "    + `1.0` becomes `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For the columns `'student_id'` and `'training_hours'`, `elif col in ['student_id', 'training_hours']:` code changes their data types to int32 using `.astype('int32')`. This helps reduce memory usage, especially if the original data type was int64. The smaller int32 uses less memory and is sufficient for storing integers that fit within the 32-bit range.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The column `'city_development_index'` is converted to `float16 (16-bit floating-point format)` by the following code:\n",
    "  \n",
    "```\n",
    "elif col in ['student_id', 'training_hours']:\n",
    "        ds_jobs_transformed[col] = ds_jobs_transformed[col].astype('int32')\n",
    " ```\n",
    "  + `float16` consumes less memory than the default `float64`.\n",
    "  + It’s useful for reducing the memory footprint of large datasets when the precision provided by `float16` is sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For columns that are in the `ordered_cats` dictionary created earlier, the code below converts them to ordered categorical data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "elif col in ordered_cats.keys():\n",
    "    category = pd.CategoricalDtype(ordered_cats[col], ordered=True)\n",
    "    ds_jobs_transformed[col] = ds_jobs_transformed[col].astype(category)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `ordered_cats` is a dictionary that contains the order of categories for certain columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `pd.CategoricalDtype` creates a categorical data type with a specific order, which is useful when the categories have a meaningful order (e.g., educational levels or experience).\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ordered=True` ensures that the categories are treated as ordered (e.g., \"Primary School\" < \"High School\" < \"Graduate\").\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `.astype(category)` applies this conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For all remaining columns (those not handled in the previous conditions), the code below converts them to the standard categorical data type without an explicit order.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
